# Objective:

I've created this project following the instruction in Module 1 Assignment Lab: CSV to JSON Converter.

My main idea is to use `csvtojson`library to convert csv data to json. I also used `jest` library to implement the unit test script to ensure all function is working correctly before running the main script.

# Setup & Running Guide:
1. Install NodeJs.
2. Go to the base directory then type this command to install dependencies:
```
$ npm install
```
3. Run the unit tests by this command:
```
$ npm test
```
You also should see that all test cases are passed.
4. Run the main script by this command:
```
$ npm start
```
5. After executing the script, you should see `customer-data.json` at `resources` directly.
